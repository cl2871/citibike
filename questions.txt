Usual Questions

Whats the correlation between Citibike usage and weather (rain, snow, temp)?
What are the most frequently used stations?
What are some trends based on rider demographics data?

Other Questions

How is usage during national holidays?

What stations are typically empty? What stations are typically full?
Where can we add solar panel covers?

What are the profit margins on operating Citibike? Are they bleeding money from relatively low annual pricing and high use rate by annual riders?
What is the minimum average trip time for a user to go to a given boba shop using Citibike?

Hard Questions (may require machine learning skills that I don't have)

Can we predict which stations would be empty or full at a particular time of day?
Can we predict usage based on MTA outages? 
Is Citibike an effective alternative to MTA in certain areas?
